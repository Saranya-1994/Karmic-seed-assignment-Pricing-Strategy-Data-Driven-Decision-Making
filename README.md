Pricing strategy framework

The objective of this assignment is to design and explain a data-driven pricing strategy that can be realistically applied in a business environment.

The analysis focuses on moving away from reactive, ad-hoc pricing decisions toward a structured, repeatable pricing framework that balances:

1.Profitability and cost protection

2.Customer demand and conversion behavior

3.Inventory health and operational risk

4.Competitive market positioning

Multiple datasets covering pricing, historical sales, inventory health, advertising performance, and competitor pricing were analyzed and integrated at the SKU level.

Using Python as the analytical tool, the assignment delivers:

1.A rule-based dynamic pricing framework

2.Clear pricing guardrails anchored to cost and margin thresholds

3.SKU-level price recommendations supported by demand and inventory signals

4.Business-ready insights suitable for leadership decision-making

The final output is an executive-ready pricing framework that is:

1.Transparent and explainable

2.Operationally feasible

3.Scalable across products

4.Aligned with real-world business objectives
